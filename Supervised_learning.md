## Definition

Supervised Learning is an approach where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions.

## Key Elements of Supervised Learning

- Input data
- Output labels
- Labeled dataset
- Model
- Training
  
## Real-World Use Cases of Supervised Learning

- Image Classification

## Popular Supervised Learning Algorithms

### 1. Regression Models

Regression models aim to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

**Assumptions:**
- Linearity
- Independence
- Homoscedasticity
- Normality of Residuals
- No Perfect Multicollinearity

#### 1.1. Simple Linear Regression

Equation: 𝑌 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑋 + 𝜖

#### 1.2. Multiple Linear Regression

Equation: 𝑌 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑋1 + 𝛽2𝑋2 + … + 𝛽𝑛𝑋𝑛 + 𝜖

#### 1.3. Nonlinear Linear Regression

Used when the relationship between dependent and independent variables is nonlinear.

### 2. Classification Algorithms

Classification algorithms assign predefined labels or categories to input data based on its features.

**Common Classification Algorithms:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

#### 2.1. Logistic Regression

Suitable for binary and multiclass classification tasks, predicting the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class.

#### 2.2. Decision Trees

Used for both classification and regression tasks, making decisions based on input features through recursive partitioning.

#### 2.3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes in the feature space.

### 3. Ensemble Learning

Ensemble Learning combines decisions from multiple models to improve performance and mitigate errors.

**Types of Ensemble Learning:**
- Max Voting
- Averaging
- Weighted Averaging
- Soft Voting
- Hard Voting
