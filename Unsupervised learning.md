# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition

Unsupervised learning refers to machine learning techniques that deal with the exploration and extraction of patterns from unlabeled data.

## Clustering

- **Definition**:
  - Clustering involves grouping similar data points together to create clusters where data points within the same cluster share more similarities with each other than with those in other clusters. The goal is to uncover the inherent structure of the data.

- **Different clustering approaches**:
  1. Centroid-Based Clustering
  2. Hierarchical Clustering
  3. Density-Based Clustering
  4. Distribution-Based Clustering
  5. Graph-Based Clustering
  6. Fuzzy Clustering
  7. Model-Based Clustering

- **1. Centroid-Based Clustering**:
  - This approach partitions the data into clusters, where each cluster is represented by a centroid. One of the most widely used algorithms in this category is K-Means.
  - K-Means Algorithm:
    - Randomly select 𝑘 initial centroids.
    - For each data point 𝑥𝑖, compute its distance to each centroid 𝑐𝑗.
    - Assign 𝑥𝑖 to the cluster with the nearest centroid.
    - Recalculate the centroids based on the data points in each cluster (update).
    - Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence criteria are met.
  - Objective Function (Cost Function):
    - The K-Means algorithm minimizes the objective function, often referred to as the “within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)” or “inertia”.

- **2. Hierarchical Clustering**:
  - Hierarchical clustering organizes data points into a tree-like structure known as a dendrogram. It creates a hierarchy of clusters, revealing relationships and structures within the dataset. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) and does not require a predefined number of clusters.

## Dimensionality Reduction

- Dimensionality reduction involves transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, preserving essential information while improving computational efficiency and model performance.

- **Different dimensionality reduction approaches**:
  1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  2. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  3. Autoencoders

- **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  - PCA transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation by capturing the most significant variance in the data through principal components. The steps involved include data mean-centering, covariance matrix calculation, eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix, and principal components selection.

## Anomaly Detection

- Anomaly detection identifies data points that do not fit well with the rest of the data. It is used for various applications such as fraud detection, surveillance, diagnosis, data cleanup, and predictive maintenance.

- Anomalies or outliers come in three types:
  - Point Anomalies
  - Contextual Anomalies
  - Collective Anomalies
